         <h3>Clean classic aircraft</h3>
         <p>  Clean classic aircraft with amazing engine sound. Seats were a bit narrow, but okay for a flight of around one hour and ten minutes. Cabin staff was friendly, sandwich and lemonades, water were provided free. Excellent experience.

             <h3>Flights on time</h3>
             <p> Aircraft clean with immaculately presented and polite cabin attendants. Seat comfortable with great leg room. Flights on time. Inflight entertainment consisted of soothing and relaxing type music. Food was a cold burger with a choice of water, coffee, tea or soft drink.

            <summary style="font-size: 30px;font-family: 'Agbalumo', serif;">From: Texas City to: Great Britain - &#9733 &#9733 &#9733 &#9733 &#9734</summary>
             <h3>The aircraft was clean</h3>
             <p> The departure and arrival were punctual, staff smiling and friendly, the aircraft, including toilets, was clean and there were magazines and newspapers at the entrance. The food was a chicken burger but the drink selection was rather limited, either water or one type of soft drink. It is maybe not the most luxurious airline but the service for a short-haul flight is better than European or American airlines I have used for the same distance.
